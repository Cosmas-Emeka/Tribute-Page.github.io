                <h4><u>Below is a breif time line of Alan Mathison Turing:</u></h4> 
                <ul>
                    <li><b>June 23, 1912 : </b>Born in Maide Vale, London, England.</li>

                    <li><b>August 19, 1926 : </b>At the age of 13, Alan Turing first showed signs of intelligence and potential which was noticed at the Sherborne School.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>August 29, 1931 : </b>Studied at King's College, in Cambridge. He was first in his class and was an honor student in the field of mathematics.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>September 30, 1936 : </b>Went ahead to Study mathematics and cryptology while also building three of four stages of an electro-mechanical binary multiplier at Princeton University.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>1936 : </b> Alan Turing won the smith's prize award for the work on probability theory</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>December 6, 1939 : </b>Turing helped to solve the essential part of the German naval indicator system and also came up with the idea of sequential analysis.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>March 18, 1940 : </b>Turing was responsible for creating the Bombe which was a cryptanalytic machine used to decrypt the Enigma-enciphered messages being sent from the enemies.</li> 
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>November 29, 1942 : </b>Turing traveled to the United States to work with the US naval cryptanalysts to create their version of the Bombe and an Enigma in Washington.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>February 19, 1946 : </b>He presented his paper in February of 1946 where he had presented the first detailed design of a stored program computer setup.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>September 13, 1947 : </b>Turing lived in Hampton, London where worked on the design of the ACE (Automatic Computing Engine).</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>March 19, 1948 : </b>Turing was appointed a position in the mathematics department at the University of Manchester where he worked on software for one of the earliest stored-program computers.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>August 31, 1948 : </b>Turing created the LU decomposition method that was used and is still used today to solve matrix equations.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>April 29, 1950 : </b>Alan Turin created a machine known as the turing test. It was created to compare the intelligence of a machine/computer to the intelligence of a human brain and is considered as the backbone of artificial intelligence today.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>January 29, 1952 : </b>Turing's book "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis" was published which was all about his interest in the biology of organisms.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>January 29, 1952 : </b>Turing was caught in a relationship with an unemployed 19 year old man. He was convicted for gross indecency because homosexual acts were considered criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time and avoided prison by accepting chemical castration. This is what lead to his downhill spiral right before his suicide.</li>
                    <hr>
                    <li><b>June 8, 1954 : </b>Turing committed suicide in his house where his housekeeper found him dead.</li>
